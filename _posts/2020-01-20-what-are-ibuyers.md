We keep receiving questions about iBuyers. What are they? What do they do? So today we’re answering some of your questions.

iBuyers are a newer phenomenon we keep hearing about in the industry, but **honestly, they’ve been around for a long time.** An iBuyer is just another cash buyer that wants to buy your home for convenience. You don’t have to worry about listing or showings, and their goal is to make a profit on your house. The iBuyer has institutionalized the “We buy ugly houses” spectacle that has existed for 30 years.&nbsp;

We real estate agents are trying to sell your property for the most money possible. For them, it’s convenience. Think of it as a wholesale purchase versus a retail purchase. When we list your home, we’re going to bring a lot of buyers to you, and that can drive up the price.

**An iBuyer is going to give you a quick offer for cash,** and a lot of times they can close within a week. They will do an inspection and likely give you a number that will include repair costs, then they’ll let you choose your closing day. However, when you sell to an iBuyer, do not expect them to pay top dollar.&nbsp;

If you want to assess if an iBuyer is the right choice for you, contact us by phone or email. We know the best iBuyers out there and we can help evaluate the offer and compare it to the price and timing you would have if you sold your property the traditional way with our team. One way isn’t necessarily better than the other, it depends on the situation. If you need a quick sale and certainty, and you’re willing to take less money, sometimes an iBuyer is a great route.&nbsp;

**Get us involved. We want to be a resource for you.** If you want to know any more information about iBuyers, please reach out to us.
