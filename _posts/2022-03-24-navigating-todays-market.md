Should you buy or sell your home in 2022? Record-high inflation and home prices have been hot topics of conversation, and everyone's wondering what will happen.

We may not be able to predict exactly what's going to happen, but house prices tend to rise with inflation. **Many experts predict that prices will continue to go up**; for example, Bank of America is forecasting that home prices will rise 10% by the end of 2022. This could increase most buyers' urgency as they rush to lock in rates.

Another thing to keep in mind is that rising household incomes, favorable demographics, and shifting preferences due to remote work could also put pressure on price growth. If you're concerned about inflation, the good news is that buying real estate is one of the best ways to hedge your money against it. For those who are thinking about selling their home, **you’re likely to get top dollar.**

If you have questions or would like to talk to a professional about whether you should buy or sell a home this year, please give us a call. We would love to hear from you.
