It’s once again that time of year to pay your property taxes. **Your 2019 property taxes are due by January 31, 2020.** If you escrow your taxes, your mortgage company will be paying those, usually in December but sometimes in January.&nbsp;

What if you’re unhappy with your assessed value and want to protest your taxes? You’ll gather supporting data and complete a protest form (sent to you in the mail) by May 15, 2020.&nbsp;

If you purchased a new construction home in 2019, it’s not uncommon for the builders to miscalculate the tax proration credit at closing. Compare the tax statement with your closing statement to see if the builder owes you money. If you have any issues with that process, please contact us and we can help you with that.&nbsp;

Finally, if you purchased a home in 2019 and want to file for your homestead exemption, you need to do so by April 30, 2020. **This exemption allows for a tax break on your property taxes and will stay on the property for future years.&nbsp;**
