Here are three easily avoidable mistakes we unfortunately see sellers make all the time:&nbsp;

**1\. Picking the wrong agent.** We frequently get calls from people who are deeply dissatisfied with their current listing agent. When you’re interviewing an agent, make sure that they’re responsive; test to see how quickly they return your calls or reply to emails. Also, ask them about their experience. How many sales do they have under their belt? Do they truly know your area?

**2\. Overpricing your house.** This can happen when a seller is too emotional, and/or their Realtor is less than honest or fails to correctly base the selling strategy on past sales. Never forget that your house is worth the amount someone is willing to pay for it.&nbsp;

Buyers will be comparing homes with similar square footage and amenities against yours. If you’ve overpriced, it will become apparent, and buyers won’t bother scheduling a showing. If you have to do a bunch of price reductions because your house is lingering on the market, you’ll take a financial hit and become discouraged.&nbsp;

**3\. Not staging or preparing the home.** Too often, I see sellers leave clutter around their homes and fail to tidy things up. People will make their initial assessment of your house online these days, and if it looks disorganized or distractingly full of personal belongings, your ability to sell will be negatively impacted. Staging is a simple step to take that goes a long way toward helping you get top dollar.&nbsp;

If you’re thinking about selling your house, please let us know if we can answer any questions or provide you with more detailed information on this or any other pertinent topic. Feel free to reach out via email or phone. We’d be glad to hear from you.
