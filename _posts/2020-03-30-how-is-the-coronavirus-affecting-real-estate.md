I hope you and your family are safe, healthy, and practicing social distancing. During these uncertain times, I wanted to get a quick message out there to let you know that we’re here for you. I also want to let you know that despite the ongoing pandemic, we’re still getting homes sold at a pretty normal pace. One positive about today’s market is that interest rates remain at all-time lows, which is driving the home buying and refinance markets.

If you have questions about this or any other real estate topic, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help.
