When is a good time to list your home? Is that time now?&nbsp;

The answer depends. Many different factors that go into making the decision to list. A piece of advice I like to give potential home sellers is to look at the three Ws: why, work, and when.

<u><strong>Why:</strong></u> Why are you listing your home? Are you moving to another state, or buying another home? Do you want to live in a different school district? There are a lot of reasons why someone would sell their home, and these kinds of questions play a big role in determining when you should list.&nbsp;

**<u>Work:</u>** Putting your house on the market requires putting in work, and I don’t mean just moving couches and touching up the paint job. You’ll have to go through your finances to make sure you can purchase your next home comfortably. This is what I have all of my clients do first, so talk to a mortgage professional and make sure you’re comfortable with your finances.&nbsp;

You’ll also have to do research, and this is where a team like ours can help you. If you work with us, we’ll go over comparable home sales in your neighborhood, what the competition looks like, and whether anything is preventing you from selling in a reasonable time frame for the best price.&nbsp;

Lastly, you’ll have to make updates and repairs to your home. Believe it or not, this might be the easiest part of the work aspect, and we can help you with this as well. We can recommend little repairs—make sure you don’t get caught up in things that don’t matter when the time comes.&nbsp;

<u><strong>When:</strong></u> After you’ve determined your ‘why’ and put the work in, it’s just a matter of when to go live on the market. Again, the answer depends on each situation, which is why you should work with a team like ours and take advantage of our professional one-on-one advice.&nbsp;

If you have questions about this or any other real estate topic, or you’re thinking of buying a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d be happy to help.
