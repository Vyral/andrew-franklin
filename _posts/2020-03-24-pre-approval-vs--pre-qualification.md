Mortgage pre-qualification is an informal evaluation of your financial picture and creditworthiness. It’s a vital step for those who aren’t quite sure what (or if) they can afford to buy. If you are more confident in your finances, you want to get a pre-approval instead. Your lender will pull your credit reports and collect your financial documents. If you have lower credit, this pull could affect it, but your score won’t change for 45 days after that inquiry. If you’re pre-approved, you’re ready to pull the trigger on an offer when you find the right home.
