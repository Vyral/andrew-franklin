We’re happy to announce we’ve recently partnered with Knock and can now provide their Home Swap services. In a hot market like ours, it’s difficult for homeowners to find a new property after selling their current one. The Knock Home Swap program allows you to buy a new home before selling, and Knock will cover your old mortgage in the meantime.&nbsp;

Knock will even pre-pay up to $25,000 to get your home market-ready. Only a few agents in the country are able to provide this service, so you’ll rarely find something like this outside of our team.&nbsp;

If you’re ready to talk about how the Knock Home Swap program can help you with your buying and selling needs, feel free to reach out to us. We’d be happy to answer any questions you may have. Until then, we look forward to hearing from you soon.
