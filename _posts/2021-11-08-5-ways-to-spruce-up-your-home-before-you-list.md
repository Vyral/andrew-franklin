Today we’re going to talk about five ways you can improve your home before putting it on the market:

**1\. Improve the security of your home.** This can include putting on a new garage door, repairing the fence, or installing a security system.

**2\. Make your home more energy efficient.** This helps the environment and cuts back on energy bills, both of which buyers will pay extra for.

**3\. Increase your storage space.** You can install a set of garage shelves, an improved closet system, or a streamlined pantry.&nbsp;

**4\. Add functional fun.** Make your home more enjoyable by adding an outdoor kitchen, building a theatre room, or adding an outdoor fireplace. Outdoor space is essential in today’s market.

**5\. Install health-forward add-ons.** Homes equipped with no-touch faucets, mudrooms, air filtration systems, and other health and comfort features are sure to win over modern buyers.
