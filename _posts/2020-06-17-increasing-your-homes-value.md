If you’d like to increase your home’s value before selling it, here are several tips that will do the trick without breaking the bank.

Starting on the outside:

**1\. Boost the curb appeal.** The first thing potential buyers see when they pull up to your house is its exterior, so boost its curb appeal by focusing on the property’s landscaping. Freshen up the mulch, plant some flowers, trim and prune the trees and bushes, add specific landscape lighting, etc. If you have any extra bricks or stones lying around, I also suggest creating some borders around your sidewalks or gardens. Buyers like these kinds of details.&nbsp;

**2\. Reseal any areas that need it with exterior caulking.** The entry points of your home, for example, need to continually be sealed. Not only will this work in your favor when it’s time for the home inspection, but it will also prevent any future water damage.&nbsp;

**3\. Fix up your fence.** Whether this means resealing or repainting it, the more you take care of your fence, the longer you’ll go without having to spend money to repair it.&nbsp;

**4\. Touch up the front door.** Your home’s front door must be inviting, so applying a fresh coat of paint or refinishing it can go a long way. You should also consider adding new hardware. These are all quick fixes you can do by yourself.

Moving to the inside:

**1\. Apply a fresh coat of paint.** This is an inexpensive upgrade that only takes a little sweat equity, and it’s an activity in which the whole family can get involved\! While you’re doing this, you should also check whether there are any areas on the wall that need to be repaired.&nbsp;

**2\. Upgrade the fixtures.** Upgrading the knobs, light fixtures, ceiling fans, and other hardware throughout the house is another job you can do yourself. If you do these tasks a little bit at a time, you can also save a lot of money.&nbsp;

**3\. Add crown molding.** Not only does crown molding add a measure of charm to your home, but it also adds long-term value. There are plenty of instructional videos online that can show you how to do this.

**4\. Recaulk the kitchen and bathrooms**. Caulk disintegrates over time, and if you don’t replace it in these areas, water can leak behind your sink or into the cabinetry and cause damage that you’ll have to repair before selling. This should be a regular part of your home maintenance schedule anyway, so I recommend doing it once a year.&nbsp;

**5\. Declutter and organize.** Start in the garage—adding shelving and organizing different areas here will make your home look cleaner and open up extra storage space. I also suggest adding shelving to your attic so you have more space to store decorations and other similar items. After that, turn your attention toward your closets, cabinets, and pantry. Having these areas organized will save you a lot of time when preparing your home for sale.&nbsp;
